I recently undertook as a mentor at the NASA Space Apps Hackathon, one of the world's largest hackathon events. My involvement took place in Brazil, specifically in Niterói, where we witnessed the second-largest Space Apps Hackathon in the country.

Throughout this remarkable event, I had the privilege of assisting numerous participants
in their journeys of development and innovation. In my role as a mentor, my primary
responsibility was to provide technical support in various programming languages
and frameworks, clarifying doubts, and offering valuable guidance for project creation.
Additionally, I assisted participants with their presentations, refining their pitches
to convey their ideas in the most effective manner.

My commitment to the event was unwavering, as I participated throughout the entire
weekend. I was on-site on Saturday from 8 am to 6 pm, and from 7 pm until the end
of Sunday, I remained in a virtual Zoom room, where I continued to support and guide
all the competitors.

One of the most enriching experiences was the opportunity to exchange knowledge and
expertise with other mentors—highly skilled professionals who share the same passion
for technology and innovation. I learned as much from them as I hope to have contributed
to the growth of the participants.
