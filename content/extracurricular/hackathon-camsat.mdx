The hackathon centered around the creation of a Cansat (satellite within a can) using Arduino Uno. Our challenge involved measuring temperature, atmospheric pressure, gases, and various other parameters. The amalgamation of the pressure, contemplating whether my code would run, coupled with the exhilaration of witnessing my code in action, created an infectious experience for me that is challenging to articulate.

My role within the team began as a manager, organizing information and disseminating it to the team, assigning tasks based on each individual's expertise. It culminated in developing the backend using Python with Flask and SQL Server, MySQL with phpMyAdmin for the database, and seamlessly integrating it into the frontend, despite having only a basic understanding of Python.

I received data from the Arduino, stored it in the database, filtered the information
using Python/SQL, and relayed it to Flask in real-time. Employing Flask, I utilized
routes to transfer the data to the frontend. On the frontend, I employed JavaScript
functions to retrieve data at regular intervals, consistently presenting real-time
information.

For the first time in my life, I had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon, and I never expected to secure the 1st position on my initial attempt.
